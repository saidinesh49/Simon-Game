When you press Enter and start, then you have to pay attention on two things, 
1. On the indicating color at that level.
2. And the sequence you click.(You have to remember the sequence, like for
𝗘𝗫𝗔𝗠𝗣𝗟𝗘: if at the level-0(starting) the indication color is green, then just click green, after that when enter into next level (level-1) then lets assume the indication color is blue, then at this time you have to click ok both Green and Blue (as the sequence) and likewise your game will move on) if you enter wrong sequence then Game-Over, you can start again.)
